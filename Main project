1.1 What is Soil Health?

Soil health is defined as the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans. Healthy soil gives us clean air and water, bountiful crops and forests, productive grazing lands, diverse wildlife, and beautiful landscapes. Soil does all this by performing five essential functions:

•	Regulating water:
Soil helps control where rain, snowmelt, and irrigation water goes. Water flows over the land or into and through the soil.
•	Sustaining plant and animal life:
The diversity and productivity of living things depends on soil.
•	Filtering and buffering potential pollutants:
The minerals and microbes in soil are responsible for filtering, buffering, degrading, immobilizing, and detoxifying organic and inorganic materials, including industrial and municipal by-products and atmospheric deposits.
•	Cycling nutrients:
Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and many other nutrients are stored, transformed, and cycled in the soil.
•	Providing physical stability and support:
Soil structure provides a medium for plant roots. Soils also provide support for human structures and protection for archeological treasures.

4.4 Feature Engineering and Selection
Feature engineering and selection form a critical backbone of any machine‐learning pipeline. In the context of soil health analysis—where raw measurements (e.g., pH, nutrient concentrations, texture) need to be transformed into meaningful predictors—these steps directly impact model accuracy and interpretability. When combined with a conversational chatbot interface, well‐engineered features ensure that farmers receive reliable and actionable insights. This section outlines, in detail, the systematic methodology for crafting, evaluating, and selecting features in a soil‐health‐driven predictive system.
4.4.1 Overview and Objectives
•	Objective: Derive and select a compact, high‐quality set of features that:
1.	Capture the underlying soil‐crop relationships.
2.	Improve model performance (classification/regression) for predicting soil fertility and crop recommendations.
3.	Facilitate interpretability—so the chatbot can explain why certain suggestions are made.
•	Context: Inputs come from soil laboratory tests, remote sensing data, farmer‐reported values, and possibly weather or geospatial data. The final features will be fed into machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) and then exposed through a chatbot interface so that end‐users (farmers) can query and receive recommendations based on their specific soil profile.
4.4.2 Step 1: Raw Data Audit and Understanding
1.	List All Available Variables
o	Physical parameters: Soil texture (sand/silt/clay percentages), bulk density, moisture content.
o	Chemical parameters: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), macronutrients (N, P, K), secondary nutrients (Ca, Mg, S), micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn).
o	Biological parameters (if available): Microbial biomass carbon, enzymatic activities.
o	Auxiliary data: GPS coordinates, elevation, crop history, irrigation type, weather/historical rainfall, remote‐sensed indices (e.g., NDVI).
2.	Assess Data Quality
o	Missingness: Determine which features have missing values (e.g., some farmers may not provide micronutrient assays).
o	Measurement units and scales: Ensure all nutrients are reported in consistent units (e.g., mg/kg or ppm).
o	Outliers and anomalies: Spot improbable values (e.g., pH outside the 3.5–9 range).
o	Data distribution: Plot histograms or boxplots for each attribute to identify skewness or heavy tails.
3.	Define Target(s)
o	Potential target variables:
	Soil fertility class: “Low,” “Medium,” “High”—based on a composite fertility index.
	Recommended crop yield (continuous).
	Fertilizer dosage recommendation (multiclass or continuous).
	Crop choice suggestion (categorical: e.g., “Maize,” “Wheat,” “Soybean”).
o	Label Generation: If using historical yield data, compute actual yields per plot and define target thresholds (e.g., top third yield = “High Yield”).
4.4.3 Step 2: Feature Engineering (Creation of New Variables)
Feature engineering takes raw measurements and domain knowledge to produce variables that carry stronger predictive signals.
2.1. Domain‐Knowledge‐Driven Transformations
1.	Ratios and Indices
o	Nutrient Ratios:
	N:P ratio, N:K ratio, P:K ratio.
	Ca:Mg ratio (critical for soil structure and nutrient uptake).
o	Base Saturation Percentage (BSP)
BSP=Ca+Mg+K+NaCEC×100\text{BSP} = \frac{\text{Ca} + \text{Mg} + \text{K} + \text{Na}}{\text{CEC}} \times 100BSP=CECCa+Mg+K+Na×100 
(where CEC = cation exchange capacity).
o	Soluble Salts Index
Soluble Salts≈EC5\text{Soluble Salts} \approx \frac{\text{EC}}{5}Soluble Salts≈5EC 
(a simplified estimate when EC is given in dS/m).
2.	pH‐Based Categorical Buckets
o	Define a new feature “pH_class” with values:
	“Strongly acidic” (< 5.5)
	“Moderately acidic” (5.5 – 6.5)
	“Neutral” (6.5 – 7.5)
	“Alkaline” (> 7.5)
o	This bucketed variable can be useful for certain decision‐tree models to quickly split on pH categories rather than continuous pH.
3.	Soil Texture Classes
o	If raw data include sand%, silt%, clay%, derive the standardized USDA texture class (e.g., “Loamy sand,” “Sandy loam,” “Clay loam”).
o	One‐hot encode these texture classes (e.g., texture_LoamySand, texture_SandyLoam, etc.).
4.	Organic Matter Indices
o	Convert organic carbon (OC) to “Organic Matter Percentage” using the Van Bemmelen factor (OC × 1.724).
o	Then bucket:
	“Very low OM” (< 1.5%)
	“Low OM” (1.5 – 3.0%)
	“Medium OM” (3.0 – 5.0%)
	“High OM” (> 5.0%)
